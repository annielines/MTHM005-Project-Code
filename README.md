This repository contains all the code developed and used in MTHM005 Project Report. The files corresponding to each figure have been outlined below.

### Figures in the Main Report:
- Figure 2: produced using contour_plot.m.
- Figure 3: produced using phase_portraits.m.
- Figure 4: produced using num_varying_p.m and num_varying_p.mat.
- Figure 5: produced using visualisations.m, error_bars.m, and error_bars_data.mat.
- Figure 6: produced using trajectories.m and trajectories.mat.

### Figures in the Technical Appendix:
- Figure 7: produced using phase_portraits.m.
- Figure 8: produced using num_varying_q.m and num_varying_q.mat.

### Additional Functions:
- G_fixed_degree.m: generates a random graph with fixed number of nodes where each node has the same degree.
- coev_nonlinear_voter_model.m: implements the Nonlinear Coevolutionary Voter Model for binary opinion states.
